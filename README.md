# ScreenBang
ScreenBang is a tool designed to leverage the Flipper Zero in BadUSB mode to discreetly capture a screenshot of a Windows machine and send it directly to a Discord server via a webhook. The project is built with stealth and automation in mind, ensuring minimal visibility on the target machine.
